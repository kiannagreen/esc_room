-- Our Project:
Quill, Kianna and I are working on a "Choose your own adventure" with an escape room twist. 
When going through the adventure, you as the "Adventurer" will be presented with choices that will take you to different paths in the story. 

-- The framework of the project
Adventurer is presented with a story, prompt, and responses. There are 2 responses the Adventurer can choose from,
which determines their next prompt. The prompts will guide the Adventurer towards the end of the route.

-- Easter eggs! 
There are also hidden parts within the game, which are easter eggs. Based on answers the Adeventurer provides, this may open up a special area for their eyes only. 

-- Possible bumps/roadblocks/etc
When the adventure is set, we're looking to adapt this to a web app. We'll need to look into the best way to set this as a web app.
It'll be a work in progress to add our different work to the same project without overwriting any work our teammates do.
